The *Literary Research Guide* was an annotated guide to selected reference sources essential to the study of British literature, literatures of the United States, other literatures in English, and related topics. It was discontinued in December 2017.

It was written by the late James L. Harner from 1989 through the sixth edition in 2014 and then updated by Angela Courtney.
