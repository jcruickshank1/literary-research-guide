The *Literary Research Guide* was an annotated guide to selected
reference sources essential to the study of British literature,
literatures of the United States, other literatures in English, and
related topics. It was discontinued in December 2017.

It was written by the late James L. Harner from 1989 through the sixth
edition in 2014  and then updated by Angela Courtney. This repository
contains the sixth edition’s HTML, XML (DocBook v4.5), and CSS. The
